BasicProcessing2.0

Basic Setup for processing and the nanoKontrol 2.0 MIDI with no window frame and undecorated frame. And to it appear in a second screen for performance. 

Need proMidi library for processing.

Window appears in the (0,0) of the window, with the key 'a' changes to (100,0) of the current window. This works for multiple screens. 

Change this value for it to appear in a second screen with no frame.
